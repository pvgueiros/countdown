# Quickstart: Countdown Widget Setup

## Prerequisites
- Ensure tests pass and no warnings.
- Have at least one Event in the app.

## Steps
1. Build the app and the new widget target.
2. Add the smallest widget to the home screen.
3. Choose “Select Event” and pick from titles-only list.
4. Verify widget shows title, date, and app-matching countdown text.
5. Delete the selected event → widget shows placeholder; tap to reselect.

## Validation
- Locale formatting verified against device settings.
- Long titles truncate without overlap.
- Countdown text exactly matches the app for identical event dates.
